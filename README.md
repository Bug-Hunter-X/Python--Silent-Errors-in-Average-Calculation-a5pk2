This repository demonstrates a common, yet easily missed, error in Python: failing to handle edge cases in functions. Specifically, it focuses on a function to calculate the average of a list of numbers. The code shows how an empty list or list with a non-numeric value can lead to unexpected behavior (ZeroDivisionError and TypeError). The solution addresses these cases, enhancing the function's robustness and preventing silent errors.
